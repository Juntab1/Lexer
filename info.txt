What is a lexer?
    given an input like a string or a command, each character
    is seperated by keywords and turned into lexems (recognizable piece of string)

What does it take in?
    it needs code to disect and also keywords to sperate the code

Special cases:
    how to seperate = and ==?
        you can use flags to figure out how those special cases are used

Steps:
    1. divide a string by just character
    2. check if a char is a keywords
    3. identify single-char and multi-char keywords
